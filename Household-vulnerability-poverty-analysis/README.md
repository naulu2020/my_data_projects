# Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping (VAM) of Food Security in Rwanda

## Overview
Poverty in Rwanda has declined from 39.8% in 2017 to 27.4% in 2024, but some households remain vulnerable to food insecurity. This study applies a **Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping (VAM)** approach to identify households and districts most at risk, using the most recent household survey data (EICV 7, collected 2023–2024).

## Solution
The project involved:
1. **Data cleaning and anomaly correction**.
2. **Feature engineering** to create key variables. 
3. **Exploratory data analysis** to uncover trends in food consumption and expenditure.  
4. **Conclusions and recommendations** based on identified vulnerabilities.

## Methodology
- **Data Source:** EICV 7 Household Budget Survey (HBS) 2023–2024.
- **Analysis Focus:** Household demographics, poverty, food access, and expenditure patterns.  
- **Tools:** R for data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and reporting.

## Feature Engineering & Preprocessing
- Recoding and categorizing key variables such as marital status, age groups, poverty status, and food expenditure share. 
- Handling inconsistencies to ensure accurate and comparable analysis. 

## Key Insights
- Male-headed households (73.8%) spend a higher share of income on food, indicating higher vulnerability. 
- Rural households (70.7%) face higher poverty rates (27.4%) than urban households (13.7%). 
- Districts most at risk: Nyamagabe, Gisagara, and Nyanza.
- ~42% of households spend a high or very high share of income on food, reflecting market dependence.
