- Peak usage occurs around 5:00 PM.
- Station usage is driven by location rather than station capacity.
- Mechanical bikes are more available than electric bikes.

## Repository
- Open `Dublin Bike sharing demand data analysis project.ipynb` a python file for more detailed technical aspects of the project.
